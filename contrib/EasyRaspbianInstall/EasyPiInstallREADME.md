Easy Tao Wallet Install for Raspbian
<p>Double clicking on EasyPiInstall.sh and choosing to run in Terminal will automate the process of building the Q11 wallet. Once the script is complete the wallet will automatically launch.</p>
<p>This will take a few hours. Let it run. Enjoy your day.</p>
<p>Thanks to nullarmo for the step by step guide... this just automates it via a bash script.</p>
<p>To import your wallet.dat file copy it from your mac or PC and place it in:</p>
<pre><code>/home/pi/.Tao
</code></pre>
<p>This is a hidden folder but can easily be accessed by copying and pasting it from this guide into File Manager.
Replace the wallet.dat file that was created during install with your wallet.dat file from your old computer. Just remember to close out of the Q11 wallet on your new stakebox as well as your old computer before replacing. Only run one client at a time (either Pi or Mac/PC) so staking doesn't mess up.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
